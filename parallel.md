Directions & Questions:  

1) Explore the figures by moving lines and points and ticking the boxes. Note the way in which the measures of angles change when you alter the points and lines.

2) You can observe one-pair of Alternate Interior, Alternate Exterior, and Corresponding Angles marked.  Can you discover all of them in this rendition?  How many of each can you find?

3) Can you also spot the Linear Pair angles and Vertical angles? You can calculate most of them by knowing just a a minimum amount of data.  

4) What is the minimum amount of information you need to know to constrain the entire configuration?

5) You can also move, "measure" slopes and angles by clicking the 3 buttons on the top right of the embedded app and following instructions that appear.
