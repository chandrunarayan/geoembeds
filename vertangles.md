# Vertical Angles Conjecture

Definition: Vertical Angles are angles whose sides form 2 pairs of opposite rays. 

When 2 lines intersect, 2 pairs of vertical angles are formed. One pair of vertical angles is shown below.  
(Click the other checkbox on the right to display the other pair of vertical angles.)  

Interact with the following for a few minutes, then answer the questions that follow.
